<div style="text-align: justify">I predicted the winner of upcoming UFC fights with an accuracy of 0.66 using a linear SVM classifier. The past MMA event and athlete data was scraped from the official UFC Stats website with BeautifulSoup. To display the predictions, I developed a web application using the Streamlit open‑source framework and deployed via the Heroku cloud platform.

<div style="text-align: justify">My team predicted whether a company would outperform the S&P 500 with an accuracy of 0.67 using a k‑nearest neighbors classifier. Historical stock returns were collected using the Alpha Vantage API. For each company, a filtered bag‑of‑words model was created from the forward‑looking text of each company’s SEC annual reporting.</div>

### Accessible Infectious Disease Forecasting

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/emagnusson88/infectious-disease)

<div style="text-align: justify">My team created an interactive web app for forecasting COVID-19 cases using Shiny. The raw data is pulled from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus repository. Future case counts are forecasted with a SEIR compartmental model. Users are able to upload their own data in an effort to make COVID-19 forecasting more accessible.</div>
